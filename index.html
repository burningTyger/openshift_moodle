        <h1>Moodle for Openshift</h1>

<p>Moodle is a well known learning management system (lms) used by many schools and organisations around the world. If you need a personal install or a platfor for a small school this Openshift Quickstart might be the right thing for you. Openshift offers a 500MB instance for free which is more than enough if you just need something that works and you still have the options to scale your application if you have to. </p>

<p>If you're ready to start follow this manual. </p>

<h2>Current Moodle Version</h2>

<p>To see which version of Moodle you're getting with master see the <a href="https://github.com/burningTyger/openshift_moodle/blob/master/VERSION">VERSION</a> file.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>In order to go through this manual you will need a couple of things first:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby (1.8.7 and up)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a></li>
</ul><p>If you need help with this see the Openshift help pages: <a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/community/get-started">https://openshift.redhat.com/community/get-started</a></p>

<h3>Getting ready</h3>

<p>Make sure you have an account or create a new one at <a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/account/new">https://openshift.redhat.com/app/account/new</a></p>

<p>Install the rhc gem:</p>

<pre><code>gem install rhc
</code></pre>

<p>and set up your environment:</p>

<pre><code>rhc setup
</code></pre>

<h2>Creating the app</h2>

<p>To create the new app go to your console and use the rhc gem. In the following examples we're using <code>moodle</code> as our app name (you're free to pick any other name you like) and <code>me</code> as our username/domain.</p>

<pre><code>rhc app create moodle php-5.3
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new app that will be available as <a href="https://moodle-me.rhcloud.com">https://moodle-me.rhcloud.com</a></p>

<p>During the setup process rhc spits out a lot of information. You should copy them into a document so that you can chaeck their values at a later point, e.g. when looging in via SSH.</p>

<p>During the creation of your new app rhc also created a new directory called <code>moodle</code> which contains the repository of your app, i.e. it is a clone of your app.</p>

<p>Now that you have the app created you need to add some cartridges to it:</p>

<pre><code>rhc cartridge add cron-1.4 -a moodle
rhc cartridge add mysql-5.1 -a moodle
rhc cartridge add phpmyadmin-3.4 -a moodle
</code></pre>

<p>The last one is optional but quite useful if you need to edit your database manually and with a nice GUI.</p>

<p>The first cartridge lets you use cron which you will need for daily cron jobs like sending out notifications and cleaning up the database.</p>

<p>The second cartridge is your database.</p>

<h3>Getting Moodle</h3>

<p>Now that you created your app with all the necessary cartridges you still need Moodle in your repository. </p>

<pre><code>cd moodle
git remote add upstream -m master git@github.com:burningTyger/openshift_moodle.git
git pull upstream master
</code></pre>

<p>These commands will add my openshift_moodle repository to your app and will then pull in everything from there to popuate your app repository with it.</p>

<p>However, the <code>php</code> inside your repository which holds the Moodle submodule will be empty. Nothing to worry about. Since it is a submodule and you don't need to change anything inside that directory it will be fetched by Openshift during your next step.</p>

<p>After this you have everything ready to push your newly created Moodle app to Openshift:</p>

<pre><code>git push origin HEAD:master
</code></pre>

<p>It will take a while to upload the repository to Openshift and it takes quite some time to load the Moodle repository which is a submoduel inside your Openshift repository. Once this is done you can head over to your new Moodle site: <a href="https://moodle-me.rhcloud.com">https://moodle-me.rhcloud.com</a> (use your own domain here).</p>

<p>You should now be able to install Moodle in your browser and set everything up according to your needs. </p>

<p><em>You made it!</em></p>

<h3>Updating Moodle</h3>

<p><strong>Note</strong> I'm thinking of using different branches for the different versions. For now you will have to use this howto:</p>

<p>Every once in a while you should update/upgrade your moodle install. Be careful though, Moodle has many versions in parallel and I'll try to stick to the latest stable version available. The problem here is you need to be on the latest old stable version in order to upgrade to the latest stable version. So before you in a few weeks upgrade to version 2.5 stable which is currently a dev branch you need to upgrade to the latest 2.4 version first and then switch branches in order to upgrade to 2.5 stable.</p>

<p>There are two possible ways of updating your repository, one is following cloesely my updates on my repository and updating your repository accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>git pull upstream master
</code></pre>

<p>I will tag my updates so you can see if I switch branches to a newer version on Moodle. So usually I will tag my last commit of a branch like <code>last_23</code> which you need to pull first, upgrade Moodle by running the update script and then pulling the next commits.</p>

<p>The other way is updating your Moodle submodule yourself:</p>

<pre><code>cd moodle/php
git checkout &lt;commit_you_want&gt;
cd ..
git commit -am 'updating moodle'
git push origin HEAD:master
</code></pre>

<p>But here's the same idea, you need to make sure you're upgrading correctly. Moodle breaks easily after an incorrect upgrade. If you're unsure make use of Openshift's snapshot utility:</p>

<pre><code>rhc snapshot save -a moodle
</code></pre>

<p><em>Good luck!</em>      </p>
